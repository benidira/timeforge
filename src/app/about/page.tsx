      <h2>What Castov is</h2>
      <p>
        Developers, analysts and support teams constantly meet times written as long numbers or unfamiliar strings. Castov
        turns them into something readable, and back again, without a login or a wall of options. Every tool has its own page
        with a short explanation, worked examples and answers to common questions.
      </p>

      <h2>How the tools work</h2>
      <p>
        All conversions run in your browser using JavaScript and the built-in Intl time zone support. The time zone rules come
        from the IANA time zone database that ships with your browser, so daylight saving time follows the rules for the exact
        date you enter. Nothing you type is sent to a server.
      </p>


      <h2>Who builds Castov?</h2>
      <p>
        Castov is maintained by <strong>Abdelouahab Benidira</strong> and the Castov Engineering team. We are passionate about creating privacy-first, blazing fast developer tools.

      <h2>What we focus on</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Correct results, including negative timestamps, leap years and daylight saving gaps.</li>
        <li>Clear, readable error messages instead of cryptic browser errors.</li>
        <li>Pages that load quickly and work well on a phone.</li>
        <li>Explanations written to be useful, not to fill space.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Accuracy and limits</h2>
      <p>
        Results depend on your browser&apos;s date support, so dates are limited to the years 1 to 9999. Unix time ignores leap
        seconds, as most software does. For legal, financial or safety-critical timing, verify results against an authoritative
        source.
