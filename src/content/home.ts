  {
    q: "Is TimeForge really free?",
    a: "Yes. All tools are free, with no account and no usage limits. The site may show ads in the future to cover running costs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data sent to a server?",
    a: "No. The converters run in your browser, so the timestamps and dates you enter are not uploaded. The only thing stored on your device is your light or dark theme choice.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a Unix timestamp?",
    a: "A Unix timestamp is the number of seconds since 1 January 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC. It identifies one moment in time regardless of time zone, which is why programs and APIs use it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I use seconds or milliseconds?",
    a: "Use whichever your system produces. A 10-digit value is in seconds and a 13-digit value is in milliseconds. The converters can detect the unit for you.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which time zones are supported?",
    a: "All IANA time zones supported by your browser, such as America/New_York, Europe/Paris, Africa/Algiers and Asia/Tokyo, with daylight saving time rules applied for the date you choose.",
  },
